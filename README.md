A small Stage Show for [DJ Windows 98](https://twitter.com/djwindows98), created during SxSW 2015 Music Hackathon by Felix Rieseberg and Mohammed Adenwala from Microsoft.

In detail, the small show was made with Unity 5 and Kinect. It featured various "VHS Art" animations inspired by the classic Windows 98 look. A Kinect aimed at audience members scanned for movement, putting 3D skeletons of scanned fans into the animation - allowing them to interact with the scene and triggering various events inside the tiny scene.

## I want to try this out!
You're in luck - all you need is a Kinect v2 for Windows.

## Issues & Development
Keep in mind that this is a small hack made in less than 18 hours, fueled by fast food, energy drinks and coffee. You'll probably find unnecessary, potentially even bad code. Nothing in here should be considered best practice or production-ready.
